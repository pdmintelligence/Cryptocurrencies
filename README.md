Cryptocurrencies

The module focused on creating a dataset assessing crypto currencies on the marketplace. During the data cleaning stage, null values were dropped, strings were converted into numeric values, and the dataframes were scaled to suit the needs of machine learning modeling. 

K Mean Clustering and other methods were used for clustering crypto currencies based on similar characteristics.
